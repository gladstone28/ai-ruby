ChatGPT:Thought about Ruby web application example for 4 seconds

Building the example

Iâ€™m crafting a minimal "Hello, world" Sinatra web application. This involves setting up routes and creating a basic server configuration file.

Weighing options

Considering Ruby on Rails or Sinatra for a "Hello, world" app. Sinatra appears better due to its simplicity and minimal code requirements.

Below is an example of a simple web application built in Ruby using the Sinatra framework. Sinatra is a lightweight DSL for quickly creating web applications in Ruby. This example will create a small web app that displays "Hello, world from Sinatra!" on the home page.
